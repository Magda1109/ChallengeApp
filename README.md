# ChallengeApp

This is my first application- student's GradeBook. 
User can choose whether he/she would like to save statistics in computer's memory or in a separate file. 
There is possibility to add grades 0-100 and letter grades like "A", "C+" etc. 
In case user has chosen to save statistics in a file, he/she can check date and time of entered grade in a file Audit.txt.
For grades equal to 75 or less, there appears notification: "Oh no! We should inform student's parents about this fact."
There are provided statistics for all entered grades.
